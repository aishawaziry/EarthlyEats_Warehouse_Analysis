## **Inventory Management Dashboard Project**  


### Project Description
#### This project focuses on designing an interactive Excel dashboard to assist store management in monitoring inventory levels and tracking missing items efficiently. The dashboard delivers actionable insights, allowing for improved decision-making by summarizing key metrics and trends related to inventory discrepancies.
 
#### Excel is powerful data analysis and visualization tools, we will clean the dataset, perform statistical analysis, and answer key questions to gain deeper insights into movie ratings, financial performance, and other critical factors. 


### Key Objectives
1. **Monitor Missing Items:** Track missing inventory by day, time of day, and responsible staff.  
2. **Identify Trends:** Highlight patterns in missing items to inform preventive measures.  
3. **Actionable Insights:** Provide a clear visual summary to enable quick and informed decisions.  

### **Features & Functionality**  

**1. Missing Item Analysis:**  
- Track total missing items per day and time of day.  
- Analyze missing items by staff and identify their accountability.  
- Perform item-level analysis:  
  - Calculate total missing quantities for each item.  
  - Identify the top two items with the highest missing counts.  

**2. Dashboard Elements:**  
- **KPI Summary Section:** Key metrics displayed prominently, including:  
  - **Total Missing Items:** Overall missing quantities in the dataset.  
  - **Highest Missing Quantity per Day:** Peak missing item occurrences by day.  
  - **Top Missing Item:** Item with the highest missing count.  
  - **Staff Member with Most Missing Items:** Staff with the largest contribution to inventory discrepancies.  
  - **Top Items and Shifts with Missing Quantities:**  
    - Items with the highest missing counts.  
    - Time shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) with the most discrepancies.  
  - **Weekly Trends:** Missing patterns by the day of the week for trend analysis.  

**3. Interactive Filtering & Slicers:**  
- Add slicers for dynamic filtering by:  
  - Date  
  - Time of Day  
  - Responsible Staff  
  - Item Category (if available).  
- Ensure the dashboard dynamically refreshes based on slicer selections.  

**4. Data Visualization:**  
- **Trend Analysis:** Line or bar charts displaying missing item trends over time.  
- **Time-Based Patterns:** Visualization of missing items by time of day.  
- **Staff-Based Insights:** Graphical representation of missing items per staff member.  
- **Top Missing Items:** Highlight items with the highest missing counts using visual tools.
